I study at Dalian Maritime University <img src='./images/dmu.png' style='width: 1.5em;'> as an undergraduate student, and at the same time, I work as a research assistant at the DUT Artificial Intelligence Institute, Dalian.

I am now working on interdisciplinary applications of AI and multimodal LLM. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [lrj_@dlmu.edu.cn](mailto:lrj_@dlmu.edu.cn).

My research interest includes interdisciplinary applications of artificial intelligence, such as bioinformatics and AI-Transportation intersection. I have published 2 papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=oF2yD8AAAAAJ'></a> and have five more under review at international interdisciplinary AI journals. I am also highly interested in multimodal large language models (LLMs) and have worked on related projects, including the design of a tri-modal large model that integrates foot pressure, joint angles, and physician prompts.
