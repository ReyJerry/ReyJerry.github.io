I study at AI thrust in the Information Hub at HKUST(GZ) <img src='./images/hkust(gz).png' style='width: 1em;'> as a MPhil student, working on interdisciplinary applications of AI and multimodal LLM. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [l15759278244@gmail.com](mailto:l15759278244@gmail.com).

My research interest includes interdisciplinary applications of artificial intelligence, such as Bioinformatics, AI-Transportation intersection and AI for Healthcare. I have published 3 papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=oF2yD8AAAAAJ'></a> and have 5 more under review at international interdisciplinary AI journals. I am also highly interested in multimodal large language models (LLMs) and have worked on related projects, including the design of a tri-modal large model that integrates foot pressure, joint angles, and physician prompts.
