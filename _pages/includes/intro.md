I will study in Al thrust under the Information Hub at HKUST(GZ) <img src='./images/hkust(gz).png' style='width: 1em;'>  as an MPhil in the fall of 2025, working on interdisciplinary applications of AI. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [l15759278244@gmail.com](mailto:l15759278244@gmail.com).

My research interest includes interdisciplinary applications of artificial intelligence, such as Bioinformatics, AI4Transportation, AI4Sport and AI4Healthcare. I have published 3 papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oF2yD8AAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FReyJerry%2FReyJerry.github.io%2Fgoogle-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations "></a> and have 5 more under review at international interdisciplinary AI journals and conferences. I am also highly interested in multimodal large language models (LLMs) and have worked on related projects, including the design of a tri-modal large model that integrates foot pressure, joint angles, and physician prompts.
